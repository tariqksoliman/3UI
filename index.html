<p><span>On the third day of rain they had killed so many crabs inside
the house that Pelayo had to cross his drenched courtyard and throw them into
the sea, because the newborn child had a temperature all night and they thought
it was due to the stench. The world had been sad since Tuesday. Sea and sky were a single ash-gray thing and the sands of the beach,
which on March nights glimmered like powdered light, had become a stew of mud
and rotten shellfish. The light was so weak at noon that when Pelayo was coming
back to the house after throwing away the crabs, it was hard for him to see
what it was that was moving and groaning in the rear of the courtyard. He had
to go very close to see that it was an old man, a very old man, lying face down
in the mud, who, in spite of his tremendous efforts, couldn’t get up, impeded by his enormous wings.<br>
<br>
Frightened by that nightmare, Pelayo ran to get Elisenda, his wife, who was
putting compresses on the sick child, and he took her to the rear of the
courtyard. They both looked at the fallen body with a mute stupor. He was
dressed like a ragpicker. There were only a few faded hairs left on his bald
skull and very few teeth in his mouth, and his pitiful condition of a drenched
great-grandfather took away any sense of grandeur he might have had. His huge
buzzard wings, dirty and half-plucked, were forever entangled in the mud. They
looked at him so long and so closely that Pelayo and Elisenda very soon
overcame their surprise and in the end found him familiar. Then they dared
speak to him, and he answered in an incomprehensible dialect with a strong
sailor’s voice. That was how they skipped over the inconvenience of the wings
and quite intelligently concluded that he was a lonely castaway from some
foreign ship wrecked by the storm. And yet, they called in a neighbor woman who
knew everything about life and death to see him, and all she needed was one
look to show them their mistake.<br>
<br>
“He’s an angel,” she told them. “He must have been coming for the child, but
the poor fellow is so old that the rain knocked him down.”<br>
<br>
On the following day everyone knew that a flesh-and-blood angel was held
captive in Pelayo’s house. Against the judgment of the wise neighbor woman, for
whom angels in those times were the fugitive survivors of a celestial
conspiracy, they did not have the heart to club him to death. Pelayo watched
over him all afternoon from the kitchen, armed with his bailiff’s club, and
before going to bed he dragged him out of the mud and locked him up with the
hens in the wire chicken coop. In the middle of the night, when the rain
stopped, Pelayo and Elisenda were still killing crabs. A short time afterward
the child woke up without a fever and with a desire to eat. Then they felt
magnanimous and decided to put the angel on a raft with fresh water and
provisions for three days and leave him to his fate on the high seas. But when
they went out into the courtyard with the first light of dawn, they found the
whole neighborhood in front of the chicken coop having fun with the angel,
without the slightest reverence, tossing him things to eat through the openings
in the wire as if he weren’t a supernatural creature but a circus animal.<br>
<br>
Father Gonzaga arrived before seven o’clock, alarmed at the
strange news. By that time onlookers less frivolous than those at dawn had
already arrived and they were making all kinds of conjectures concerning the
captive’s future. The simplest among them thought that he should be named mayor
of the world. Others of sterner mind felt that he should be promoted to the
rank of five-star general in order to win all wars. Some visionaries hoped that
he could be put to stud in order to implant the earth a race of winged wise men
who could take charge of the universe. But Father Gonzaga, before becoming a
priest, had been a robust woodcutter. Standing by the wire, he reviewed his
catechism in an instant and asked them to open the door so that he could take a
close look at that pitiful man who looked more like a huge decrepit hen among
the fascinated chickens. He was lying in the corner drying his open wings in
the sunlight among the fruit peels and breakfast leftovers that the early
risers had thrown him. Alien to the impertinences of the world, he only lifted
his antiquarian eyes and murmured something in his dialect when Father Gonzaga
went into the chicken coop and said good morning to him in Latin. The parish
priest had his first suspicion of an imposter when he saw that he did not
understand the language of God or know how to greet His ministers. Then he
noticed that seen close up he was much too human: he had an unbearable smell of
the outdoors, the back side of his wings was strewn with parasites and his main
feathers had been mistreated by terrestrial winds, and nothing about him
measured up to the proud dignity of angels. Then he came out of the chicken
coop and in a brief sermon warned the curious against the risks of being
ingenuous. He reminded them that the devil had the bad habit of making use of
carnival tricks in order to confuse the unwary. He argued that if wings were
not the essential element in determining the different between a hawk and an
airplane, they were even less so in the recognition of angels. Nevertheless, he
promised to write a letter to his bishop so that the latter would write his
primate so that the latter would write to the Supreme Pontiff in order to get
the final verdict from the highest courts.<br>
<br>
His prudence fell on sterile hearts. The news of the captive angel spread with
such rapidity that after a few hours the courtyard had the bustle of a
marketplace and they had to call in troops with fixed bayonets to disperse the
mob that was about to knock the house down. Elisenda, her spine all twisted from
sweeping up so much marketplace trash, then got the idea of fencing in the yard
and charging five cents admission to see the angel.<br>
<br>
The curious came from far away. A traveling carnival arrived with a flying
acrobat who buzzed over the crowd several times, but no one paid any attention
to him because his wings were not those of an angel but, rather, those of a
sidereal bat. The most unfortunate invalids on earth came in search of health:
a poor woman who since childhood has been counting her heartbeats and had run
out of numbers; a Portuguese man who couldn’t sleep because the noise of the
stars disturbed him; a sleepwalker who got up at night to undo the things he
had done while awake; and many others with less serious ailments. In the midst
of that shipwreck disorder that made the earth tremble, Pelayo and Elisenda
were happy with fatigue, for in less than a week they had crammed their rooms
with money and the line of pilgrims waiting their turn to enter still reached
beyond the horizon.<br>
<br>
The angel was the only one who took no part in his own act. He spent his time
trying to get comfortable in his borrowed nest, befuddled by the hellish heat
of the oil lamps and sacramental candles that had been placed along the wire.
At first they tried to make him eat some mothballs, which, according to the
wisdom of the wise neighbor woman, were the food prescribed for angels. But he
turned them down, just as he turned down the papal lunches that the pentinents
brought him, and they never found out whether it was because he was an angel or
because he was an old man that in the end ate nothing but eggplant mush. His
only supernatural virtue seemed to be patience. Especially during the first
days, when the hens pecked at him, searching for the stellar parasites that proliferated
in his wings, and the cripples pulled out feathers to touch their defective
parts with, and even the most merciful threw stones at him, trying to get him
to rise so they could see him standing. The only time they succeeded in
arousing him was when they burned his side with an iron for branding steers,
for he had been motionless for so many hours that they thought he was dead. He
awoke with a start, ranting in his hermetic language and with tears in his
eyes, and he flapped his wings a couple of times, which brought on a whirlwind
of chicken dung and lunar dust and a gale of panic that did not seem to be of
this world. Although many thought that his reaction had not been one of rage
but of pain, from then on they were careful not to annoy him, because the
majority understood that his passivity was not that of a hero taking his ease
but that of a cataclysm in repose.<br>
<br>
Father Gonzaga held back the crowd’s frivolity with formulas of maidservant
inspiration while awaiting the arrival of a final judgment on the nature of the
captive. But the mail from Rome showed no sense
of urgency. They spent their time finding out if the prisoner had a navel, if
his dialect had any connection with Aramaic, how many times he could fit on the
head of a pin, or whether he wasn’t just a Norwegian with wings. Those meager
letters might have come and gone until the end of time if a providential event
had not put and end to the priest’s tribulations.<br>
<br>
It so happened that during those days, among so many other carnival attractions,
there arrived in the town the traveling show of the woman who had been changed
into a spider for having disobeyed her parents. The admission to see her was
not only less than the admission to see the angel, but people were permitted to
ask her all manner of questions about her absurd state and to examine her up
and down so that no one would ever doubt the truth of her horror. She was a
frightful tarantula the size of a ram and with the head of a sad maiden. What
was most heartrending, however, was not her outlandish shape but the sincere
affliction with which she recounted the details of her misfortune. While still
practically a child she had sneaked out of her parents’ house to go to a dance,
and while she was coming back through the woods after having danced all night
without permission, a fearful thunderclap rent the sky in two and through the
crack came the lightning bolt of brimstone that
changed her into a spider. Her only nourishment came from the meatballs that
charitable souls chose to toss into her mouth. A spectacle like that, full of
so much human truth and with such a fearful lesson, was bound to defeat without
even trying that of a haughty angel who scarcely deigned to look at mortals.
Besides, the few miracles attributed to the angel showed a certain mental
disorder, like the blind man who didn’t recover his sight but grew three new
teeth, or the paralytic who didn’t get to walk but almost won the lottery, and
the leper whose sores sprouted sunflowers. Those consolation miracles, which
were more like mocking fun, had already ruined the angel’s reputation when the
woman who had been changed into a spider finally crushed him completely. That
was how Father Gonzaga was cured forever of his insomnia and Pelayo’s courtyard
went back to being as empty as during the time it had rained for three days and
crabs walked through the bedrooms.<br>
<br>
The owners of the house had no reason to lament. With the money they saved they
built a two-story mansion with balconies and gardens and high netting so that
crabs wouldn’t get in during the winter, and with iron
bars on the windows so that angels wouldn’t get in. Pelayo also set up a rabbit
warren close to town and gave up his job as a bailiff for good, and Elisenda
bought some satin pumps with high heels and many dresses of iridescent silk,
the kind worn on Sunday by the most desirable women in those times. The chicken
coop was the only thing that didn’t receive any attention. If they washed it
down with creolin and burned tears of myrrh inside it every so often, it was
not in homage to the angel but to drive away the dungheap stench that still
hung everywhere like a ghost and was turning the new house into an old one. At
first, when the child learned to walk, they were careful that he not get too close to the chicken coop. But then they began to
lose their fears and got used to the smell, and before they child got his
second teeth he’d gone inside the chicken coop to play, where the wires were
falling apart. The angel was no less standoffish with him than with the other
mortals, but he tolerated the most ingenious infamies with the patience of a
dog who had no illusions. They both came down with the
chicken pox at the same time. The doctor who took care of the child couldn’t
resist the temptation to listen to the angel’s heart, and he found so much
whistling in the heart and so many sounds in his kidneys that it seemed
impossible for him to be alive. What surprised him most, however, was the logic
of his wings. They seemed so natural on that completely human organism that he
couldn’t understand why other men didn’t have them too.<br>
<br>
When the child began school it had been some time since the sun and rain had
caused the collapse of the chicken coop. The angel went dragging himself about
here and there like a stray dying man. They would drive him out of the bedroom
with a broom and a moment later find him in the
kitchen. He seemed to be in so many places at the same time that they grew to
think that he’d be duplicated, that he was reproducing himself all through the
house, and the exasperated and unhinged Elisenda shouted that it was awful
living in that hell full of angels. He could scarcely eat and his antiquarian
eyes had also become so foggy that he went about bumping into posts. All he had
left were the bare cannulae of his last feathers. Pelayo threw a blanket over
him and extended him the charity of letting him sleep in the shed, and only
then did they notice that he had a temperature at night, and was delirious with
the tongue twisters of an old Norwegian. That was one
of the few times they became alarmed, for they thought he was going to die and
not even the wise neighbor woman had been able to tell them what to do with
dead angels.<br>
<br>
And yet he not only survived his worst winter, but seemed improved with the
first sunny days. He remained motionless for several days in the farthest
corner of the courtyard, where no one would see him, and at the beginning of
December some large, stiff feathers began to grow on his wings, the feathers of
a scarecrow, which looked more like another misfortune of decreptitude. But he
must have known the reason for those changes, for he was quite careful that no
one should notice them, that no one should hear the
sea chanteys that he sometimes sang under the stars. One morning Elisenda was
cutting some bunches of onions for lunch when a wind that seemed to come from
the high seas blew into the kitchen. Then she went to the window and caught the
angel in his first attempts at flight. They were so clumsy that his fingernails
opened a furrow in the vegetable patch and he was on the point of knocking the
shed down with the ungainly flapping that slipped on the light and couldn’t get
a grip on the air. But he did manage to gain altitude. Elisenda let out a sigh
of relief, for herself and for him, when she watched him pass over the last
houses, holding himself up in some way with the risky flapping of a senile
vulture. She kept watching him even when she was through cutting the onions and
she kept on watching until it was no longer possible for her to see him,
because then he was no longer an annoyance in her life but an imaginary dot on
the horizon of the sea.</span><span></span></p>
