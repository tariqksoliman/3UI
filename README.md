# 3UI

The plan is to have new HTML tags that define 3D attributes of their contents. Someone would then be able to make a 3D webpage soley through HTML and CSS.

It uses THREE.js' CSS3DRenderer to convert the page into 3D.  

Barely started enough to even add instructions.


```webpack -w```  
```npm run dev```
